# Sistema AJAX

This project contains an HTML page (`index.html`) and all accompanying CSS and JavaScript files in the repository root. To preview the site, open `index.html` in a browser.

## File Structure
- `index.html` – main page
- `*.css` – style sheets
- `*.js` – JavaScript modules

All styles and scripts are referenced directly from the root, so ensure the files remain in the same directory as `index.html`.
